# Joe Sangiorgio Portfolio

Hello and welcome to my Portfolio site! My name is Joe Sangiorgio and I'm currently a Web Interface Developer for Marvel Entertainment. I have a passion for all things Javascript, and love creating meaningful data-driven web applications.

I made this app in order to have an interesting space to showcase the type of work I love doing. My goal was to create an environment that would present my professional products in a unique and compelling way. I also just wanted to play with some flashy cutting-edge web technologies! 🤓

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm start

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# preview production build
npm run preview
```

## Requirements

- **Node.js**: v18+ (recommended) or v22+
- **npm**: v8+
- **Platform**: macOS, Linux, or Windows (native ARM64 support on Apple Silicon)

## 🎉 Modernization Complete!

This project has been successfully migrated to modern tooling:

- ✅ **Build Tool**: Vite 4 (10-100x faster than Webpack 2)
- ✅ **Styling**: Dart Sass (modern, maintained)
- ✅ **Framework**: Vue 2.x (compatible with Vite)
- ✅ **Native Support**: ARM64 Apple Silicon (no Rosetta required!)
- ✅ **No Python**: No longer requires Python 2.7
- ✅ **Fast HMR**: Sub-second hot module replacement

**Previous stack** (2017): Webpack 2, node-sass, Python 2.7, Rosetta required  
**Current stack** (2025): Vite 4, Dart Sass, Node 18+, native ARM64

**Migration Details**: See [`docs/roadmap.md`](docs/roadmap.md) for full history
