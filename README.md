# Joe Sangiorgio Portfolio

Hello and welcome to my Portfolio site! My name is Joe Sangiorgio and I'm currently a Web Interface Developer for Marvel Entertainment. I have a passion for all things Javascript, and love creating meaningful data-driven web applications.

I made this app in order to have an interesting space to showcase the type of work I love doing. My goal was to create an environment that would present my professional products in a unique and compelling way. I also just wanted to play with some flashy cutting-edge web technologies! ðŸ¤“

## Build Setup
