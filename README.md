# joe-sangiorgio-portfolio

Hello and welcome to my Portfolio site! My name is Joe Sangiorgio and I'm currently a Web Interface Developer for Marvel Entertainment. I have a passion for all things Javascript, and love creating meaningful data-driven web applications.

I made this app in order to have an interesting space to showcase the type of work I love doing. My goal was to create an environment that would present my professional products in a unique and compelling way. I also just wanted to play with some flashy cutting-edge web technologies! ðŸ¤“

Do I realize the same content housed within this site could have been communicated in a 3kb javascript-free HTML file with a few CSS styles? Sure. Are some of the customization controls in the sidebar completely over the top? Absolutely. Should there be a need for a tour around a portfolio? Oh God no. But where's the fun in making something like that?!

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
yarn


# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
