## Progress Log

### Oct 28, 2025 - Session: Phase 5.1 Sass Deprecation Cleanup ✅ COMPLETE
**Completed:**
- Replaced all `@import` with `@use` syntax (index.scss, tour.scss, Home.vue, Resume.vue)
- Fixed division operators: `$var / 2` → `math.div($var, 2)` (ParallaxCardList.vue)
- Updated map functions: `map-get()` → `map.get()` with `sass:map` module
- Removed Sass-JSON dependency and replaced with CSS custom properties
- Added `@use "colors" as *;` to tour.scss for proper module imports
- Updated `getSassConfig()` to return colors array directly instead of parsing JSON
- Verified zero SCSS deprecation warnings in build output
- Verified zero runtime errors in browser console

**Current State:**
- ✅ Zero SCSS-level deprecation warnings
- ✅ Zero runtime errors (tested with Playwright)
- ✅ Build succeeds with clean SCSS compilation
- ✅ All features functional (theme selector, animations, tour, navigation)
- ✅ Production build working (~3s build time)
- ⚠️ Note: Remaining "legacy-js-api" warnings are from Vite/Sass integration layer (not our code)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/styles/index.scss` - Module system, CSS custom properties
- `src/styles/tour.scss` - Added colors import
- `src/components/ParallaxCardList.vue` - Division operators
- `src/components/views/Home.vue` - Import → use
- `src/components/views/Resume.vue` - Import → use
- `src/helpersMixin.js` - Hard-coded colors array (replaced Sass-JSON parsing)
- `package.json` - Removed Sass-JSON

### Oct 28, 2025 - Session: Phase 5 Vite Migration ✅ COMPLETE
**Completed:**
- Migrated from Webpack 2 to Vite 4
- Replaced node-sass with Dart Sass
- Updated Babel config to use @babel/preset-env
- Fixed SCSS imports (removed `~` prefix for node_modules)
- Converted `require()` to ES module `import` statements
- Updated build.info plugin to work with Vite
- Fixed console.rainbow helper function
- Tested dev server: All routes working, fast startup (<3s)
- Tested production build: Successful build in ~2s
- Removed 606 old dependencies (Webpack, node-sass, loaders)
- Reduced vulnerabilities from 131 to 87
- Updated .nvmrc to Node 18
- Fixed typo in joeInfo.json ("Marvel sss" → "Marvel")
- Updated README.md with new requirements
- Created manual test checklist

**Current State:**
- ✅ Dev server: Instant startup, sub-second HMR
- ✅ Production build: Works perfectly
- ✅ Native ARM64 support (no Rosetta!)
- ✅ No Python 2.7 required
- ✅ All features functional

**Issues Resolved:**
- Babel preset compatibility (es2015 → @babel/preset-env)
- SCSS import syntax (tilde prefix removal)
- Asset imports (require → import)
- Build info plugin adaptation for Vite
- console.rainbow function in production

### Oct 27, 2025 - Session: Documentation & Environment Setup
**Completed:**
- Created documentation structure (`docs/`, `docs/system/`)
- Generated comprehensive codebase analysis (see chat history)
- Reverse-engineered legacy dev setup requirements:
  - **Issue**: node-sass 4.5.0 requires x86 architecture, Python 2.7, Node 8.x
  - **Solution**: Rosetta terminal + pyenv + nvm
- Created setup documentation: `docs/system/legacy-dev-setup.md`
- Created environment check script: `scripts/check-env.sh`
- Added `.nvmrc` (8.17.0) and `.python-version` (2.7.18)
- Added `npm run check-env` command
- Updated README with Apple Silicon setup instructions
- Created proper `.gitignore`

**Current State:**
- Currently in ARM64 terminal (won't work for legacy deps)
- Need to switch to Rosetta terminal to continue
- pyenv: ✅ Python 2.7.18 available
- nvm: ✅ Node 8.17.0 available

## Next Steps

### Phase 5.1: Sass Deprecation Cleanup (Recommended Next)
**Effort**: 2-4 hours | **Risk**: Low | **Benefit**: Clean console output + future-proof

**Why do this?**
- Currently have ~50+ Sass deprecation warnings in console
- All warnings are from using old Sass syntax patterns
- Easy fixes with automated tools available
- Makes build output much cleaner

**Quick wins:**
1. Replace `@import` → `@use` syntax (automated tool available)
2. Fix division: `-$parallax-offset / 2` → `calc(-1 * $parallax-offset / 2)`
3. Update global functions: `map-get()` → `map.get()`
4. Consider replacing `Sass-JSON` library (it's the main culprit)

**See `docs/roadmap.md` Phase 5.1 for detailed implementation guide**

## Notes & Decisions

### Technical Debt Status
**Completed (Phase 5 + 5.1):**
- ✅ ~~node-sass 4.5.0~~ → Now using Dart Sass
- ✅ ~~Webpack 2~~ → Now using Vite 4
- ✅ ~~Python 2.7 requirement~~ → No longer needed
- ✅ ~~Rosetta/x86 requirement~~ → Native ARM64
- ✅ ~~606 old dependencies~~ → Removed and cleaned up
- ✅ ~~Security vulnerabilities~~ → Reduced from 131 to 87
- ✅ ~~Sass deprecation warnings~~ → All SCSS-level warnings eliminated

**Remaining:**
- **Low**: Vite legacy-js-api warnings (build tool integration, not our code)
- **Medium**: Vue 2 → Vue 3 migration (optional, deferred)
- **Low**: No TypeScript
- **Low**: No tests

### Architecture Findings
- Well-structured component architecture
- Good separation of concerns
- Reusable patterns (helpers mixin)
- Configuration-driven routing
- LocalStorage for user preferences

### Modernization Philosophy
Per the README, this site is intentionally over-engineered as a showcase. Phase 5 maintained this philosophy:
1. ✅ Maintained the "fun" factor - All animations and features work
2. ✅ Kept customization features - Theme and animation selectors work
3. ✅ Preserved interactive tour - Tour functionality intact
4. ✅ Updated to modern best practices - Vite 4, Dart Sass, ES modules
5. ✅ Improved performance - 10-100x faster dev server, instant HMR
6. ✅ Enabled easier maintenance - Native ARM64, no legacy requirements
